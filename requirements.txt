                              TO-DO
try/catch style exception handling


The issue is that I have a Hashmap storing a Hashmap as one of the values.
When updating the inside value for one of the keys, the outside value is reset.
The solution was removing the hash override from the account class because it was only using the price field.
Which of course isn't the same, that's the whole point


                              QUESTIONS
When to use an enum vs a string. Example is the action method from the account class
A way to use enum in the overridden methods from Account inside Personal and TFSA
When to override equals and hash?
If mutators aren't used by an object, get rid of them or set them private? (Account class)
If you set a return type to facilitate testing ony, should you remove it when testing is over? (account.getAccountType(), account.setAccountType())
Throwing an unchecked exception on a method vs having it return false and handle it further up in the program?
